# Seiva – Telegram AI Assistant for Sei Network

## What We Built

**Seiva** is a Telegram-based AI assistant designed specifically for the Sei Network. It brings an intuitive user experience that combines on-chain monitoring and AI interaction, making Sei more accessible for both beginners and degen users.

Users can:
- Track wallet activity on Sei (with support for multiple tokens)
- Analyze token insights (price, volume, holders, 24h change)
- Ask AI-powered questions about Sei
- Get help related to airdrops, staking, and bridging

The system is powered by n8n, OpenAI, CoinGecko API, and Sei RPC endpoints. All interaction happens seamlessly via Telegram.

## Built for Sei

Seiva was created specifically for the **DoraHacks x Sei Hackathon** with the goal to:
- Make Sei’s ecosystem easier to explore for new users
- Increase transparency of wallet/token data
- Deliver on-chain insights in a conversational format

## Hackathon Track Fit

This project aligns with the **AI Agent + Automation track** and **On-Chain Data**:
- Uses OpenAI GPT via n8n as a smart AI layer
- Real-time on-chain data from Sei RPC and REST
- Automates contextual responses and token insights
- Deployed as a Telegram bot for wide accessibility
